# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Haarcascade-Frontal-Face-Model
This Python code uses OpenCV to perform real-time face detection using a webcam. It captures video frames, converts them to grayscale, detects faces in each frame, and outlines them with green rectangles. The program runs until the 'Esc' key is pressed, at which point it releases the webcam and closes the display window.
